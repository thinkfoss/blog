The website is still in beta, and we are happy to introduce the latest change we brought. You can view it directly by going over to our beta website (beta.thinkfoss.com) [beta.thinkfoss.com] -as the changes are now up. 

###New updates as on 6 September 2015###

* All forms and fonts are changed to reflect the material design view by Google - and it was imported from https://github.com/Xerdi/Material-Design-Flipper/. Thanks to the `css` file, it completely changed our looks. You would've seen something similar in Android or the Google forms 
* We have removed the ruddy yellow banner, and replaced it with a `nav-footer`, which stays there, and add more responsiveness to mobile and low resolution devices. Finding out the right `div` was a tough job, but its done as of now
* Contact-Us form has been re-visited and now uses bootstrap `form-inline` which adds in more beauty and remove the kills the complaints with the earlier form.
* The website loads much faster now : The website went through several rounds of page speed test through https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ and https://gtmetrix.com/ and now scores a 80/100 in desktop websites, and 63/100 in mobiles. This will improve with caching expiry change, which will come up in the follow up days. 


More confidential changes are there, which will get released in future posts. Stay tuned
