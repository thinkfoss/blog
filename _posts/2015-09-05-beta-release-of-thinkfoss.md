This Teachers day, we are happy to introduce some of the innovations we have come for the Learning process with ThinkFOSS.
We released the beta version of ThinkFOSS portal, at beta.thinkfoss.com, which has a portal that can connect people with skills to people in needs of skills. The idea is simple : 'You got some skills, and you are ready to teach it online/offline for a sum - we can find you people ready to pay and learn'.

ThinkFOSS differ from the existing 1:1 training platforms available in the market in many ways which would include the open nature of its mentor-mentee relation. You can be a student today, and a mentor tomorrow or vice versa. Each and every course that come through ThinkFOSS goes through thorough review, and the course payment reach a mentor only after successful completion of a course, with the mentees consent. Open Source organizations and universities can use this as a platform to conduct workshops, get mentors and people interested.

You are welcome to visit, register and play with the beta release, and report bugs found at : phab.thinkfoss.com. The review team has done its best to give you the best service, but if something goes wrong - please report. Happy Teachers Day again.


Few features which are left out in beta would be :

* Payment gateway is not functional as of now, and the portal cannot receive/handle payments 
* The portal do not show complete details of the course and mentor as of now to a student enrolling - This will be fixed soon in a mysterious patch coming into some unknown repo in Github. 
* Various other confidential issues.

Special Thanks to our teachers, partners and my colleagues who made this possible.
